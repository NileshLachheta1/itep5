50) Java Program For Sorting An Array Of 0s, 1s and 2s

51) Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N having both negative and positive integers. The task is place all negative element at the end of array without changing the order of positive element and negative element.

Example 1:
Input : 
N = 8
arr[] = {1, -1, 3, 2, -7, -5, 11, 6 }
Output : 
1  3  2  11  6  -1  -7  -5

Example 2:
Input : 
N=8
arr[] = {-5, 7, -3, -4, 9, 10, -1, 11}
Output :
7  9  10  11  -5  -3  -4  -1

52) Count pair with given sum.
Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, K = 6
arr[] = {1,5,7,1}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4, X = 2
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation:
Each 1 will produce sum 2 with any 1.

53) Find common elements in three sorted arrays.
Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
Example 1:
Input:
n1 = 6; A = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
n2 = 5; B = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
n3 = 8; C = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20 80
Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only
common elements in A, B and C.
54)Count pair with given sum.
Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, K = 6
arr[] = {1,5,7,1}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
arr[0] + arr[1] = 1 + 5 = 6 
and arr[1] + arr[3] = 5 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 4, X = 2
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 6
Explanation:
Each 1 will produce sum 2 with any 1.

55) Find the first non-repeating element in a given array arr of N integers.
Note: Array consists of only positive and negative integers and not zero.
Example 1:
Input : arr[] = {-1, 2, -1, 3, 2}
Output : 3
Explanation:
-1 and 2 are repeating whereas 3 is 
the only number occuring once.
Hence, the output is 3.

Example 2:
Input : arr[] = {1, 1, 1}
Output : 0

56)  Java program to find nearest lesser and greater element in array
Given an array of N elements and we have to find nearest lesser and nearest greater element using Java program.
Example:
    Input:
    Enter the number of elements for the arrray : 3  
 
    Enter the elements for array_1.. 
    array_1[0] : 1   
    array_1[1] : 2   
    array_1[2] : 3   
 
    Enter the number : 2 
 
    Output:
    Element lesser than 2 is : 1 
    Element greater than 2 is : 3

57) Given two arrays of integers A and B of sizes M and N respectively. Write a Write a java program, which will produce a third array named C. such that the following sequence is followed. 
All even numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from left to right. 
All odd numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from right to left. 
All even numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from left to right. 
All old numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from right to left.

58) Max Sum in configuration

Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array.The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
A[] = {8,3,1,2}
Output: 29
Explanation: Above the configuration
possible by rotating elements are
3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+3*1+1*2+2*3 = 11
Here the max sum is 29
